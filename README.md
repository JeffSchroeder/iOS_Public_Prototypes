# iOS_Public_Prototypes

This is a repository of different prototype and proof of concept projects I have done and think are clean and finished enough to be public.  I doubt there is anything ground breaking in here but if it helps you, good. These are as is and may be a bit dated.  I will run through them from time to time and update to the latest version of swift.

These should have stripped bundle IDs so you will need to fix that.  Also any 3rd party development key will be in the plist but blank and you will have to get those from the proper developer network from the provider.  Should be documented in the project if needed.  I love pods but that would put me on the hook to actually maintain something and that is not my intent.  Enjoy.

Projects:

CameraButton - Project extends the UIButton to mimic the camera and video shutter control on the iOS Camera app.
