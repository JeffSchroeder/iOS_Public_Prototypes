# iOS_Public_Prototypes

This is a repository of different prototype and proof of concept projects I have done and think are clean and finished enough to be public. I doubt there is anything ground breaking in here but if it helps you, good. These are as is and may be a bit dated. I will run through them from time to time and update to the latest version of Xcode and Swift. All bundled IDs and 3rd party development keys have been stripped and will need to updated to run on devices.

Projects:

AttributedList - Search a list of terms and return the result list with the search term highlighted.

CameraButton - Project extends the UIButton to mimic the camera and video shutter control on the iOS Camera app.

LongPress - Allow long press to work on timer versus waiting for the finger up to happen.

MixedCode - Objc and Swift living together, mass hysteria. Quick project to make sure Swift can use ObjC and ObjC can use Swift. Functionality verified by unit tests.
